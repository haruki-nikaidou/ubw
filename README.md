# Unlimited Blade Works

> I am the bone of my sword
> 
> Steel is my body and fire is my blood
> 
> I have created over a thousand blades
> 
> Unknown to death
> 
> Nor known to life
> 
> Have withstood pain to create many weapons
> 
> Yet those hands shall never hold anything
> 
> So, as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works
